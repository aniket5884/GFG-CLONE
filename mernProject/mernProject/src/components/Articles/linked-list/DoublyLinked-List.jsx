        <h1><b>What is Doubly Linlked List?</b></h1><br></br>
        <p>A doubly linked list is a more complex data structure than a singly linked list, but it offers several advantages. The main advantage of a doubly linked list is that it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions. This is because each node in the list contains a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node. This allows for quick and easy insertion and deletion of nodes from the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list in both directions.</p>

        <h1><b>Representation of Doubly Linked List in Data Structure:</b></h1><br></br>
        <p>In a data structure, a doubly linked list is represented using nodes that have three fields:</p><br></br>
        <p>1. Data
            </p>
        <p>2. A pointer to the next node (next)</p>
        <p>3. A pointer to the previous node (prev).</p><br></br>
        <h1><b>Operations On doubly Linked List</b></h1><br></br>
        <p>1. Traversal in Doubly Linked List


</p>
        <p>2. Searching in Doubly Linked List</p>
        <p>3. Finding Length of Doubly Linked List</p>
        <div>
          <h1><b>Advantages of Doubly Linked List </b></h1><br></br>
          <p>1. Efficient traversal in both directions: Doubly linked lists allow for efficient traversal of the list in both directions, making it suitable for applications where frequent insertions and deletions are required.

</p>
          <p>2. Easy insertion and deletion of nodes: The presence of pointers to both the previous and next nodes makes it easy to insert or delete nodes from the list, without having to traverse the entire list.</p>
          <p>3. Can be used to implement a stack or queue: Doubly linked lists can be used to implement both stacks and queues, which are common data structures used in programming.</p><br></br>
          <h1><b>Disadvantages of doubly Linked List</b></h1><br></br>
          <p>1. More complex than singly linked lists: Doubly linked lists are more complex than singly linked lists, as they require additional pointers for each node.
          </p>
          <p>2. More memory overhead: Doubly linked lists require more memory overhead than singly linked lists, as each node stores two pointers instead of one.</p><br></br>
          <h1><b>Applications of Doubly Linked List</b></h1><br></br>
          <p>1. Implementation of undo and redo functionality in text editors.
Cache implementation where quick insertion and deletion of elements are required.
Browser history management to navigate back and forth between visited pages
